* Kasi Viswanath Sunkara (Student ID:700743275)
* Venkata Naga Pavan Kumar Chivukula (Student ID:700747559)

# Motivation:
* Over 130,000 people die from stroke each year in the United States, making it a major cause of death and disability.
* It may be possible to delay the beginning of this crippling disorder by being able to forecast a person's risk for stroke.
* Machine learning, which has the capacity to learn from data and generate predictions based on that learning, presents a viable answer to this issue.

# Objectives:
* The aim of this study was to develop a machine-learning algorithm that can predict the risk of stroke in patients admitted to the hospital. 
* The study included a data set of patients who were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of stroke. 
* The machine learning algorithm will be trained on the training set and then tested on the testing set. 
* The results of the study shows that the machine learning algorithm will be able to predict the risk of stroke in patients with a high degree of accuracy.

# Problem Statement:
* Stroke Prediction using machine learning is an attempt to use the power of computers to learn and predict patterns in data in order to improve health care. 
* In the case of stroke, this would involve the use of data from patient’s medical records in order to predict who is at risk for a stroke and develop strategies to prevent them from having one. 
* There are a number of factors that can increase someone’s risk for a stroke.

# Algorithms Used:
* Linear Regression
* Boosting Algorithm using Decision Tree
